 
Looking to have a property equal 0 unless another variable is on

unresolved-- user asked if there was a non-python solution

...i[s] there... an expression I can use to get this result[:] I want this property to stay 0 unless two other properties are both 1, in which case this property can be either 0 or 1. But I'm not familiar with Python so I don't know how I'd write that.

addon:
commotion
If you’ve ever needed to offset otherwise identical animations for each object, you know that it’s a big pain whenever you need to make a change. Commotion makes it easy to offset animation data, and can even do it based on proximity to other objects which makes for a nice animation / geometry nodes type effect (and was around before those two existed). 
https://github.com/mrachinskiy/commotion


Pablo Dobarro and Daniel Martinez Lara, two legendary Blender developers, once teamed up to create an add-on, called Keymesh, that brought Grease Pencil style keyframing to mesh objects for stop motion animations. That add-on has not been maintained, but the community member Aldrin Matthew has taken up the mantle and expanded its functionality by turning it into what is now Stopmagic. This is significantly different from using shapekeys because, once you've set one mesh keyframe, you can change the object in any way for the next keyframe, including adding or removing vertices. You can even use sculpting and dynamic topology to create truly clay-like effects like the animation by Andrei Apanasik https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwkItP-vVoc.

https://github.com/AldrinMathew/stopmagic
 
Dream UV (Free)
  
If you like not leaving the 3D viewport, you may also want to try the DreamUV add-on, which is a collection of UV tools for the 3D view sidebar. Its most interesting feature, in my opinion, is hotspotting. That tool will attempt to find an appropriately sized rectangle on the texture atlas and automatically fit it to the selected mesh based on the seams. DreamUV is specifically made for interactively texturing objects using tiled textures or trim sheets, so game artists should definitely give it a try.
https://github.com/leukbaars/DreamUV


Render Burst (Free)

This add-on is also very simple, but it certainly comes in handy. Render Burst will render out an image from all cameras in the scene or from all selected cameras. If you have multiple angles to shoot and just need to tweak the model or material slightly, this will save you from having to manually re-render everything.
https://github.com/VertStretch/RenderBurst

VFX Nodes (Free)

There aren’t many compositing addons out there, but for those that work with video clips in Blender’s compositor, you may want to look at VFX Nodes. This add-on adds some preset node groups for common tasks like vignetting, cloning, patching, glitching, and replacing eye colors.

https://darkfallblender.blogspot.com/p/blog-page_8.html


Screencast Keys (Free)

screencast_keys.jpg

Screencast Keys is really only helpful for those making tutorials or teaching a class, but if you’re showing someone how to do something in Blender, it’s perfect for making sure they know exactly what keys you’re pressing. If you’ve used Blender for a long time, you probably do some things automatically without even thinking! With Screencast Keys, they’ll be able to follow along regardless.
https://github.com/nutti/Screencast-Keys


Edge Flow (Free)
 

This popular 3DS Max and Maya tool has made its way over to Blender! Edge Flow uses spline interpolation to adjust edge loops to fit the surrounding geometry. You can use it to quickly clean up messy topology or better blend between two areas. It’s two operators Set Flow and Set Linear come in handy pretty often, and they’re conveniently added to the edge context menu. It’s free, simple, and adds operations that can’t be done with vanilla Blender. I’ll definitely be using it a lot!

https://github.com/BenjaminSauder/EdgeFlow/blob/master/README.md



Sketchfab (Free)
 
Similarly, the official Sketchfab add-on lets you download and use any of the hundreds (thousands?) of models posted as free on their site. It also makes it extremely easy to upload and share your models with other people. They aren't Blender-specific, so there won't be any procedural materials or ready to use rigs, but they make up for it with the sheer amount of available content.

what_I_learned_in_blender.txt

You have to mess around with Blender too much!

Always check the environment settings for the room texture, and make it look nice, or objects won't look relistic AT ALL
Under Environment Settings, check multiple importance for Surface
Map Resolution can be 1024, but constrain bounces to something like 24 here.

tone down sampling with speed ups like:

No square samples,
Clamp Indirect (3)

MANAGE LIGH PATHS
you won't need more than 8 bounces for transparency, or 4 for other bouncing (Dave Price)


current "green plastic" is not reflective of objects in  front
────────────────
rendering_notes.txt

differences in the rendering that add SO MUCH!


an ambient occlusion pass that darken what's already supposed to be in shadow

and a specular pass that pops a rim lite on the subject

(doesn't have to be obvious, but boy it's noticeable when it's not there!) maybe 4:00, 45degrees high

there's a "glamour glow" pass that adds a bloom to the shiny specular. Looks great

saving_video_from_blender.txt

To answer my own question, it looks like you can follow the answer here 

https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/15142/how-to-render-an-animation-as-video-in-blender

but instead just import the 'mistake' video file instead of the image sequence into the Video Editor, then go back to Default view, set the correct output settings and click 'Animation' to re-export the video in the new format. – eljaydub Feb 23 '16 at 21:01

creating HDRIs:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeiy-rqb894

I saw many tutorials about creating hdr by photographing multiple images with different exposure. what i need is not to create an hdr map from a scene in max or maya but to create an hdr from these multiple images that i photographed so that i can use them in vray. The problem is that after i merge them to hdr in photoshop the extension is .jpg so how can we change them to a map that can be used in max

camera projection:
set the rendered dimensions to the dimensions of the loaded in environment that you're using as a background image to project
100% scale


set the camera to approximate the focal length of the image (very important!)


anchor a corner into the floor  -- line the camera up with a cube and a floor (to represent the main obj)-- could take a while
	(use the local movement and origin in the corner of the mesh)
	
	
	
once model is constructed, use texture

(project from view, light path controlling the from camera rays to transparent shader (so that transparency is in use)

BLENDER EXERCISES:

End Product (#1)  ?:
create a snowflake Christmas ornament
use an illustrator svg
ornament complete with a dangling hook on one end
Paint the model with Painting editor, (low res color is fine)
Displace the Model with some normal maps, giving the illusion of extra detail (ie a chip, or break)
Ensure the model's edges are clear--even could be a different color via Vertex coloring


$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
You WILL LEARN:
--------
AI import
(modeling)  extrusion, modifiers (ie: bevel)
	effects (modifiers)  shouldn't have to be final as part of the object
UV mapping
	UV maps can be utilized for the hook, esp to differentiate the connected parts of the model
Normal map painting
Vertex map


NOTE:

model the mesh in one file, and LINK to the mesh from another. That will prevent model failings (such as weird rotations, etc.)


	
V2: we will take this model and:
	animate it
	rig it so it moves
	apply physics at some point to make it break

to achieve a cartoon-like surface: (VERSION 1--- dependent on the lighting setup for basic cel shading)
 sun lamp must be very small (.0001)
 position sun lamp close to object
 with a high strength; 5--2
 ambient occlusion: .11--.18, at a distance of 0
 
 node setup:
 fresnel plugged into
 color ramp with 2/3 color stops representing zones
 set color ramp to constant, instead of linear
 stops positioned very close to the end (.7--.9) of the ramp
 change ray visibility in the world tab to affect only camera at first, experiment as needed.

 "specular" toon shading:
	is actually a SECONDARY DIFFUSE SHADER
	using a lighter color with a smaller radius of the size in the toon shader
	both plugged into an ADD shader
	CAVEAT--- geometry will destroy the effect of the lighter color (the added color)
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDBORldMW_s
	(at 17 minutes, create eye colors using color stops on color ramps)
 farther into the scene, shows result of compositing and freestyle (which may not be used!) to get soft shadows with toon shading. this creates artifacts with models with transparency overlapped

VERSION 2: lighting independent, so the normals can be adjusted, allowing for clip-art style rendering (line-art, or hatching)

a layer weight -driven color ramp set to constant, 

mixed with a wave texture plugged into another constant color ramp
 (with 30 for scale, using the WINDOW input from a texture coordinate input (reversed stops from the layer-weight one)
 
 a half-tone can be applied using a MAGIC texture in the same manner as the waves texture, set from the WINDOW normal input

enable unified color on the texture brushes so that all the brushes have the same texture color when using them.

make a hard and soft brush type so that they are available for use.
(set these up with the curves in the brush menu)

the brush "profile" is akin to the button bevel selection in KIA's power tools, or contours in PS, where the left of the curve is the center of the brush, and the right of the curve is the outer edge of the brush's profile




in prefences, select a color picker:
system color picker--- square SV+H is preferred by some.

use uv seams (after the unwrap) as selection limiters

when blocking out colors, turn off occlude cull and normal off under the project painting options (helps with the flood fill)

METALS

all reflection, little diffuse

they can tint their reflection

respect fresnel!

(become more reflection on grazing angles.)

different wavelengths of light falloff at different values at grazing angles.





start with a glossy shader (for reflections)

CTRL-G for input/out

add color mix

(based on the fresnel from CynicatPro)

metal roughness respects that it causes the surface to not react with grazing angles as much

-----------------------

game engine's surfacing models account for:
Base color
Roughness
Normal
Metalness (less diffusion, more fresnel, more edge tinting)

-----------------------
regarding the "blend" factor of the "layer weight" node
the differences in the Layer Weight input Blend factor, and the Fresnel node input (IOR)
Blend:  0.00  0.10  0.50  0.70  0.80  0.90  0.95  0.98  1.00
  IOR:  1.00  1.10  1.70  3.30  5.10  10.0  20.0  50.0  1000

The Y scale is logarithmic

Confirmed by Brecht (thanks) the conversion formula is:

    IOR = 1/(1 - Blend)

    Blend = 1 - 1/IOR

	
http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/29161/relation-between-fresnel-ior-and-layerweight-blend

Physics:
(limp noodle)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lg7jxAMs60Q

-------------------


Don't know if it's what you're meaning, but i always mix my glossy with an emission shader set to black, 0 strength.


 The glossy controls the sharpness of the reflections,
 
 the mix shader controls the influence of that gloss on the total image
 
 
 Then on the mix shader between diffuse and glossy I use a layerweight node routed through a rgb curves node as the mix. This way I have as simple or complex control over the range of the mesh the reflections occur. I've made this setup a default material in my materials.blend file for appending to my projects. Just add the finer details like textures, bumps, normals, and the kitchen sink and it all just works pretty well.

Some configuration notes for the sculpt tools in Blender

Since I run a graphics tablet, THE TOOLS FOR SCULPTING NEED TO BE SET UP INDIVIDUALLY to taste.

Through experience, I've found the following to be true for the various sculpting tools:

Turn off the AUTOSMOOTH FUNCTIONALITY. It DOESN'T WORK.


SculptDraw brush tool :
	Strength:  .3
	
Smooth brush tool :
	Strength:  .25

Flatten brush tool :
	Strength:  1
	
	Set Topology rake to ON when using Dynotopology setting
	
	Dynotopology setting should be set to the power of 8, and set to the highest constant detail setting that will allow for necessary model detail.
	
	Dynotopology setting: 1024 | Subdivide/Collapse | Constant detail |smooth shading ticked on.

Making animated PIXEL ART with Blender 2.8 in 12 Minutes
(details an "inverse" rule for pixelization, but could be different than that mentioned above.)
https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLnyKRfBFsQ

This guy details the commonality of the textures, and shapes, and what angles they follow in pixel art. He details a setup for isometric angles that would be very useful. CAVEAT-- he mentions tweaking the color profile settings in blender, changing them away from filmic, and that's a huge can of worms. I'd stay away from those unless you just can't get the look you need (colors dull, or something). He also tweaks out the light so the shading is done very much in his style, so look into the way he's doing shading after you're familiar with the interface more. (His line work is almost dead-on straight out of the render though):
https://www.youtube.com/embed/7W2na8OKC8U
this same guy has a more advanced tutorial using an add-on for blender (that he wrote) too, so save this for the vault (I downloaded the addon and it's written in python. since you learned that, you can see how it's done too) HE EVEN MANAGED TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO DO AUTOMATIC DITHERING.  He goes into great detail about the compositor, while using his addon, and the information is really good. He is teaching how to make node groups to increase the legibility of the node area while performing specific tasks:

this guy shows an interesting time sink equivalency and good reason to use blender (your time is important-- and cleaning the pixel art is where the greatness will lie-- should you look for it between the blocks) and he outlines other videos to enjoy. He is using the same software you want to learn to clean up.

STEP BY STEP TUTORIAL : https://youtu.be/eSqb6II3WMM

Summary of the workflow :

I created and rigged a 3d model of the character in Blender with exagerated features so it would pixelize well. Then I created the 8 frames walking animation and I change the camera 45 degre with each loop.

I use "Freestyle" to create the outer lines and a composite shader to get the pixelized effect.

Then I render all the frames and I use Aseprite to do the clean up and add things like the eyes.

If this interest you, here is what I did to learn how to do this with blender :

1- I followed the whole donut tutorial : https://youtu.be/TPrnSACiTJ4 Its a high quality tutorial, well explained, it gives a glimpse of the whole Blender workflow.

2-I followed the chair tutorial : https://youtu.be/Hf2esGA7vCc Same Youtuber but this tutorial is very modeling oriented.

3- I Followed some character modeling tutorials. There is a shitload of them on youtube. The one I ended up watching the most is this one : https://youtu.be/NDAalAojTvo Its low poly, and its style seemed perfect to pixelize.

https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDAalAojTvo

4- I watched this tutorial on how to make hair : https://youtu.be/BqWYgrXw7Jk Thats how I made the hair and the cape falling behind my character.

5- I watched this tutorial on how to pixelize my renders : https://youtu.be/AQcovwUHMf0 I was so impressed with the result, this is how I will save thousands of hours on making my game.

6- I did this tutorial to learn how to weight and rig my character : https://youtu.be/srpOeu9UUBU

7- And those ones to learn how to use IK for legs and arms animation : (legs) https://youtu.be/Pt3-mHBCoQk (arms) https://youtu.be/0bFrZn8xlLw

8 - As for the cloths and accessories, Im using some tricks shown in this video : https://youtu.be/U7lKIFfHffY

9 - Finally, I tried many techniques to do the outline, many of witch was far too complex for me and overkill for a render that will be pixelized anyway. So I ended up using Freestyle, using this tutorial to learn how : https://youtu.be/p7mr71nfjFY,

My first attempt was ok : https://imgur.com/a/xzjHE9R My second attempt was better : https://imgur.com/a/1xhLh1A Then I practice making clothes which ended up looking like garbage bag : https://imgur.com/a/CpXlqdr But the pixelize effect was already convincing : https://imgur.com/a/ZoGhr59 https://imgur.com/a/sEIAwLz Then I started working on my character with what I learned : https://imgur.com/a/9rIoz4q https://imgur.com/a/EmjCood

And it ended up like this : https://imgur.com/a/iXpPDzQ

And I find it looked great with the pixelize effect : https://imgur.com/a/DstwzsS

After that I used Aseprite to touch up the 2d sprite.

Blender:
Baking multiple textures into one texture map:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60fuFYkohrw
you must have the bake texture referenced inside the material that will be transferred to the new image.
This means that each material must have a representative image node for the final "collective" texture.
