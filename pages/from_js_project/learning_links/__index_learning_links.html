				<p>What is this page of links?</p>
				<p>
					This is a page that attempts to curate lists of found videos and links regarding subjects under my study.
					I've watched or visited and found these very useful.
				</p>
				<p>
					This list will continue to grow, and I will rarely check to see if link rot has affected it, but due to
					the nature of most of the links, if the files have been deleted from youtube, I assume the images will
					appear broken, and will serve as clues to the viability of the links.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the viewer sees a "IMAGE NOT AVAILABLE" indicator, that
					<em style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">DOES NOT</em>
					signal the link is broken, only that there is no youtube preview image for the link, as it isn't
					necessarily a video link, but a helpful link not directed to the you tube site. (editor note: later links
					have been built with an effort to utilize a found image on a cdn server that's associated with the
					content of the link to serve as a visual aid.)

					Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or
					otherwise expressive content. Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal, defined by a small
					number of specific elements. There is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are.

					A film genre is a stylistic or thematic category for motion pictures [also known as movies] based on
					similarities either in the narrative elements, aesthetic approach, or the emotional response to the film.
					Drawing heavily from the theories of literary-genre criticism, film genres are usually delineated by
					"conventions, iconography, settings, narratives, characters and actors". Films are also classified by
					tone, theme/topic, mood, format, target audience, or budget.

					Art is a highly diverse range of human activities which create visual, auditory, or performed artifacts—
					artworks—that express the author's imaginative or technical skill, and are intended to be appreciated for
					their beauty or emotional power. What makes art beautiful is a complicated concept, since beauty is
					subjective and can change based on context. However, there is a basic human instinct, or internal
					appreciation, for harmony, balance, and rhythm which can be defined as beauty. Beauty in terms of art
					usually refers to an interaction between line, color, texture, sound, shape, motion, and size that is
					pleasing to the senses.

					Described in Jurassic Park by Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician and proponent of the theory, chaos theory
					essentially looks for underlying patterns in apparently random, complex events. Although the idea of
					"chaos" invokes messiness, chaos theory is concerned with incredibly precise accounting of variables.
					Theoretician Edward Lorenz explains that chaos is where the present determines the future, but the
					approximate present can't determine an approximate future—or, as Malcolm would say, the tiny variables
					present in any system multiply as the system develops. Any understanding of a system that doesn't (or
					can't) account for all the tiny variables— an approximate understanding— will thus be incapable of
					accurately predicting the system's outcome.

					Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling

					World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and
					presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility,
					since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and
					control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
					formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate place.
