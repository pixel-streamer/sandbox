							How to describe music to create a prompt for an AI text-to-music tool
						</h2>
						<p>
							To create a prompt for an AI text-to-music tool , you'll want to provide a clear and detailed
							description of the music you have in mind.
						</p>
						<p>Here's a template for structuring your description:</p>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Genre and style.</strong></li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Begin by specifying the genre or style you want the music to be in. For example, "I want a
							classical piano piece" or "Create an electronic dance track."
						</p>
						<p><strong>2. Mood and emotion.</strong></p>
						<p>
							Describe the mood and emotion you want the music to convey. Use adjectives to express the desired
							feeling, such as "uplifting," "mournful," "energetic," or "relaxing."
						</p>
						<p><strong>3. Instrumentation.</strong></p>
						<p>
							Specify the instruments you want to be used in the composition. For example, "Include violins,
							flutes, and harp" or "Focus on synthesizers and drums."
						</p>
						<p><strong>4. Melodic elements.</strong></p>
						<p>
							Mention any specific melodic elements you have in mind. You can describe the type of melody you
							want, whether it should be catchy, soaring, or gentle.
						</p>
						<p><strong>5. Harmony and chords.</strong></p>
						<p>
							Explain the harmony and chord progressions you prefer. You can mention if you want dissonant or
							consonant harmonies or specific chord changes.
						</p>
						<p><strong>6. Rhythm and tempo.</strong></p>
						<p>
							Specify the desired rhythm and tempo. Use adjectives like "fast," "slow," "syncopated," or "steady"
							to convey the rhythm you're looking for.
						</p>
						<p><strong>7. Dynamics.</strong></p>
						<p>
							Mention how the dynamics should change throughout the piece. Describe whether you want gradual
							crescendos, sudden accents, or a steady dynamic level.

						<p>
							Indicate the overall structure you have in mind, whether it's a simple
							<a href="https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-musicapp-medieval-modern/chapter/ternary-form/">
								A-B-A form
							</a>
							, a more complex structure, or any specific musical form.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also include any other details or specific requirements you have, such as key signature,
							time signature, or thematic elements if applicable.
						</p>

						<hr />
						<p>Here's an example [AI] prompt:</p>
						<p>
							"I need an electronic dance track with a fast tempo and an energetic, upbeat mood. Please use
							synthesizers, drums, and bass. The melody should be catchy and memorable, and I'd like to hear a
							combination of consonant and dissonant harmonies. Incorporate dynamic changes with gradual
							crescendos, and the overall form should follow a verse-chorus-verse structure. Feel free to add
							some vocal samples for an extra layer of depth."
