				<h1>Four posts has a stable bed.</h1>
				<p>The Four Seasons</p>
				<p>Breaking Up Is Hard to Do: by The Four Seasons</p>
				<p>"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" is a song recorded by
				 Neil Sedaka, co-written by Sedaka and Howard Greenfield.
				  Sedaka recorded this song twice, in 1962 and 1975,
				   in two significantly different arrangements, 
				   and it is considered to be his signature song.
				</p>
				<p>
				   Between 1970 and 1975, it was a top-40 hit three separate 
				   times for three separate artists: Lenny Welch, The Partridge Family,
				    and Sedaka's second version. </p>

				<h1>Seven O'Clock</h1>
				<p>Pearl Jam - Seven O'Clock (Lyrics)</p>
				<p>I've been listening to Pearl Jam ever since I was 3 years old thanks
				 to my Mum and Aunt and I love there new album and this song especially. 
				 Yes, it is a different sound from when they made Ten, but artists can 
				 change their sound but still be reccognise as 'Yes, this is Pearl Jam'. </p>

				<h1>8 Songs with the Number Eight in the Title</h1>
				<p>'Eight Days A Week' by The Beatles (1964)</p>
				<p>Fortunately, I came across the idea last number column to help me with
				 an issue of a lack of songs I like with the number eight. Eight songs about 8 seems fine!
				 But, truth be told, I found very few featuring nine or ten, so the next (and at this
				 stage last) number column will be out of order.</p>
